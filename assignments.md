    - Generate Columns and Rows based in JSON array passed to it
    - Accept 'CanDelete' property from parent, if this is true then each row of teh Datagrid will show 'Delete' button, when this button is pressed, then the data of the row must be deleted from Parent
    - Accept 'CanSortReverse', property from parent, if this is true theneach columnheader will show sort and reverse buttons (u can use bootstrap) to sort and reverse data from the DataGrid based on the column row data
